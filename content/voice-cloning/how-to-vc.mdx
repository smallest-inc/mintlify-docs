In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Smallest AI platform to create a voice by uploading an audio file. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to clone your voice using our API.

You can access the source code for the Python SDK on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smallest-inc/smallest-python-sdk).

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python (3.9 or higher) installed on your machine.
- An API key from the Smallest AI platform (sign up [here](https://waves.smallest.ai)).

## Setup

### Install our SDK
```bash
pip install smallestai
```

Set your API key as an environment variable. 
```bash
export SMALLEST_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
``` 

## Add your Voice  
The Smallest AI SDK allows you to clone your voice by uploading an audio file. This feature is available both synchronously and asynchronously, making it flexible for different use cases. Below are examples of how to use this functionality.  

### Synchronously  

<CodeGroup> 
```python python 
from smallest import Smallest

def main(): 
    client = Smallest(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    res = client.add_voice(display_name="My Voice", file_path="my_voice.wav")
    print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    main()
```
</CodeGroup>   

### Asynchronously
<CodeGroup>
```python python
import asyncio
from smallest import AsyncSmallest

async def main():
    client = AsyncSmallest(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    res = await client.add_voice(display_name="My Voice", file_path="my_voice.wav")
    print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>  

## Parameters    

- `api_key`: Your API key (can be set via SMALLEST_API_KEY environment variable).
- `display_name`: Name of the voice to be created.
- `file_path`: Path to the audio file to be cloned.  

These parameters are part of the add_voice function. They can be set when calling the function as shown above.  

## Get All Cloned Voices  

Once you have cloned your voices, you can retrieve a list of all cloned voices associated with your account using the following code:  
<CodeGroup>
```python python
from smallest import Smallest

client = Smallest(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
print(f"Available Voices: {client.get_cloned_voices()}")
```
</CodeGroup>
