## Step 1: Sign Up & get the API Key  

1. Visit [waves.smallest.ai](https://waves.smallest.ai/) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have an account.  
2. Navigate to `API Key` tab in your account dashboard.
3. Create a new API Key and copy it.
4. Export the API Key in your environment with the name `SMALLEST_API_KEY`, ensuring that your application can access it securely for authentication.  

## Step 2: Install the SDK

To install the latest version available   
```bash
pip install smallestai
```  
When using an SDK in your application, make sure to pin to at least the major version (e.g., ==1.*). This helps ensure your application remains stable and avoids potential issues from breaking changes in future updates.  

## Step 3: Make Your First API Call
Here is a basic example of how to use the Python SDK to convert text to speech:  
<Note>
If you are using a `voice_id` corresponding to a voice clone, you should explicitly set the `model` parameter to `"lightning-large"` in the `Smallest` client or payload.
</Note>
<CodeGroup>
```python python
from smallest import Smallest

def main():
    client = Smallest(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    client.synthesize(
        "Modern problems require modern solutions.",
        sample_rate=24000,
        speed=1.0,
        save_as="output.wav"
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</CodeGroup>  

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained in Step 2.  

## Step 4: Explore More Features

- **Voice Cloning:** Create custom voice profiles by uploading voice samples.
- **Advanced Configurations:** Customize speech synthesis with different voices, speeds, and sample rates.
