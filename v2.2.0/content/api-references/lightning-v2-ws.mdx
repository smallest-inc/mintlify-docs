title: 'Text to Speech (WebSocket)'
description: The Lightning v2 WebSocket API provides real-time text-to-speech streaming capabilities with high-quality voice synthesis. This API uses WebSocket to deliver audio chunks as they're generated, enabling low-latency audio playback without waiting for the entire audio file to process. For an end-to-end example of how to use the Lightning v2 WebSocket API, check out [Text to Speech (WS) Example](https://github.com/smallest-inc/waves-examples/tree/main/lightning_v2/ws_streaming)
