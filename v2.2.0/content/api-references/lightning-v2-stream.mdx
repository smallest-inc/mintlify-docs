## Overview

The Lightning v2 SSE API provides real-time text-to-speech streaming capabilities with high-quality voice synthesis. This API uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to deliver audio chunks as they're generated, enabling low-latency audio playback without waiting for the entire audio file to process.
For an end-to-end example of how to use the Lightning v2 SSE API, check out [Text to Speech (SSE) Example](https://github.com/smallest-inc/waves-examples/blob/main/lightning_v2/http_streaming/http_streaming_api.py)

## When to Use

- **Interactive Applications**: Perfect for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other applications requiring immediate voice responses
- **Long-Form Content**: Efficiently stream audio for articles, stories, or other long-form content without buffering delays
- **Voice User Interfaces**: Create natural-sounding voice interfaces with minimal perceived latency
- **Accessibility Solutions**: Provide real-time audio versions of written content for users with visual impairments

## How It Works

1. **Make a POST Request**: Send your text and voice settings to the API endpoint
2. **Receive Audio Chunks**: The API processes your text and streams audio back as base64-encoded chunks with 1024 byte size
3. **Process the Stream**: Handle the SSE events to decode and play audio chunks sequentially
4. **End of Stream**: The API sends a completion event when all audio has been delivered
