In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Smallest AI platform to fetch the available languages, models, and voices. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to retrieve and display this information using the Smallest AI SDK.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python (3.9 or higher) installed on your machine.  
- An API key from the Smallest AI platform (sign up [here](https://waves.smallest.ai)).  
- The Smallest AI Python SDK installed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions below:

### Install the SDK
```bash
pip install smallestai
```

Set your API key as an environment variable:  
```bash
export SMALLEST_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Fetch Available Voices, Models, and Languages

The Smallest AI SDK allows you to query the available languages, voices, and models for your TTS needs. Here's how you can do it:   
<Note>
If you are using a `voice_id` corresponding to a voice clone, you should explicitly set the `model` parameter to `"lightning-large"` in the `Smallest` client or payload.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```python python
from smallest import Smallest

def main():
    client = Smallest(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    # Get available languages
    languages = client.get_languages()
    print(f"Available Languages: {languages}")
    
    # Get available voices for the "lightning" model, alternatively `lightning-large`
    voices = client.get_voices(model="lightning")
    print(f"Available Voices (Model: 'lightning'): {voices}")
    
    # Get user-specific cloned voices
    cloned_voices = client.get_cloned_voices()
    print(f"Available Cloned Voices: {cloned_voices}")
    
    # Get available models
    models = client.get_models()
    print(f"Available Models: {models}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Explanation of Functions

- `get_languages()`: Retrieves the list of supported languages for Text-to-Speech.  
- `get_voices(model="model_name")`: Retrieves the voices available for a specific model (e.g., "lightning").  
- `get_cloned_voices()`: Fetches all user-specific cloned voices.  
- `get_models()`: Retrieves the TTS models on the platform available through API.
